# Projects

<div class="content-container">

Here are some of the key projects I've worked on, spanning geospatial systems, web development, and game development.

## AI-Driven Development

<div class="ai-workflow-section">

## My AI Development Workflow

I've embraced AI-assisted development as a core part of my workflow, using **Claude** and **Cursor IDE** to accelerate development while maintaining high code quality. This approach enables faster delivery of scalable, production-ready solutions.

- **Faster Architecture Decisions** - AI helps evaluate trade-offs and suggest scalable patterns
- **Rapid Prototyping** - Transform ideas into working code in hours instead of days
- **Code Quality** - AI-assisted code review catches issues early
- **Documentation** - Auto-generated docs and inline comments
