- **Spatial Analysis**: Custom tools for Line of Sight, Viewshed Analysis, terrain profiling, and coverage calculation
- **Data Streaming**: 3D Tiles optimization for massive datasets and real-time terrain rendering
- **Defense Systems**: Mission planning tools, tactical monitoring, and synchronized dual-map interfaces

**Technical Integration**
- Coordinate system transformations and projection handling
- Real-time data integration with WebSocket and REST APIs
- Performance optimization for large-scale geospatial datasets
- Custom spatial analysis algorithms and computational geometry

### 3D Web Applications

**Interactive 3D Experiences**
- **WebGL Optimization**: High-performance 3D rendering in browsers
- **Unity WebGL**: Integrating Unity3D applications with modern web frameworks
- **Real-time Rendering**: Smooth 60fps experiences with complex 3D scenes
- **Cross-Platform**: Ensuring consistent performance across desktop and mobile browsers

## AI-Augmented Development Workflow

<div class="ai-workflow-about">

I've integrated AI tools into my development process to deliver enterprise-grade software faster without compromising quality. Using **Claude** for architecture and **Cursor IDE** for intelligent coding assistance, I've achieved 2-3x faster development cycles.

**How AI Powers My Workflow:**
- **Architecture Design**: Claude evaluates patterns, suggests optimizations, and helps design scalable systems
- **Rapid Prototyping**: Transform requirements into working code in hours instead of days
- **Code Quality**: AI-assisted review catches bugs, security issues, and performance problems early
- **Documentation**: Auto-generated docs, inline comments, and technical documentation
- **Problem Solving**: Quick exploration of multiple approaches to complex challenges

**Real-World Results:**
- Built a complete defense planning system with 3D visualization in record time
- Developed cross-platform mobile app with backend infrastructure in parallel
- Created data analysis platform with full visualization suite rapidly

My decade of software engineering experience ensures I know *what* to build, while AI helps me build it faster and better.

## Currently Exploring

Staying ahead of the curve with cutting-edge technologies:

- **AI-Powered Development**: Claude Code (CLI), Cursor IDE, and MCP (Model Context Protocol) integrations
- **LLM Applications**: Building AI-powered features into production applications
- **Advanced Flutter**: Cross-platform mobile development with native performance
- **Microservices**: Distributed architectures and service mesh patterns
- **WebAssembly**: Performance-critical web applications with near-native speed

## Background in Game Development

With 10 years of Unity3D experience, I've published 50+ games across mobile and PC platforms. This background gives me unique expertise in:
- Real-time rendering and performance optimization
- Complex state management and game architecture
- Cross-platform development (WebGL, iOS, Android, Steam)
- 3D mathematics, physics systems, and interactive experiences

While my focus has shifted to full-stack development, this foundation enables me to build exceptional 3D web applications and understand performance at a deeper level.
