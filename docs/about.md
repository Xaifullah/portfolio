# About Me

<div class="content-container">

## Who I Am

I'm **Saifullah Sadi**, a software engineer with a decade of experience bridging the worlds of immersive game development, geospatial applications, and cutting-edge simulation technologies. I architect scalable solutions that transform complex spatial data into interactive, real-time experiences.

## Specialized Pillars of Expertise

### 1. Unity & Game Development

- **Engine Mastery**: 10 years of experience with **Unity3D** across WebGL, Mobile (iOS/Android), and PC/Desktop environments
- **Architecture**: Expert in building **cross-platform SDKs** and character creation pipelines (3D avatar systems)
- **Core Systems**: Advanced C# scripting, real-time multiplayer networking, and complex UI/UX integration within 3D environments
- **Graphics**: Specialized in **WebGL optimization**, shader implementation, and performance tuning for browser-based 3D

### 2. Full-Stack Web Development

- **Frontend**: Professional-grade development using **Vue.js** and **React.js** powered by **TypeScript**
- **Backend**: Scalable microservices and RESTful API design using **Node.js** and **Express.js**
- **Infrastructure**: Database management (SQL/NoSQL), authentication systems, and cloud-ready application architecture
- **Tools**: Git, Docker, CI/CD pipelines, and Agile-driven development workflows

### 3. Geospatial & 3D Simulation

- **Defense & GIS**: Development of **customized GIS applications** specifically tailored for defense systems and mission planning
- **Large-Scale Visualization**: Handling massive 3D datasets, 3D Tiles, and terrain streaming optimization in **CesiumJS** (3D) and **OpenLayers** (2D)
- **Advanced Spatial Analysis**: Engineered custom tactical tools including **Line of Sight (LoS)**, **Viewshed Analysis**, and terrain profile calculation
- **Simulation Systems**: Architecting **Dual-Map systems** with synchronized 2D/3D transitions for real-time tactical monitoring

## What Drives Me

- **Innovation**: Pushing the boundaries of what's possible with real-time 3D and geospatial technology
- **Problem-Solving**: Turning complex technical challenges into elegant, performant solutions
- **Cross-Domain Expertise**: Bridging game development, web technologies, and geospatial systems
- **Performance**: Optimizing for the best user experience across all platforms


## AI-Augmented Development Workflow

<div class="ai-workflow-about">

I've integrated AI tools into my development process to deliver higher-quality software faster. Using **Claude** for architecture decisions and **Cursor IDE** for AI-assisted coding, I've transformed how I approach complex projects in web and geospatial development.

**How AI Enhances My Work:**
- **Architecture Planning**: Claude helps evaluate design patterns and trade-offs for scalable systems
- **Code Generation**: Cursor accelerates boilerplate and repetitive code
- **Code Review**: AI catches potential issues before they become bugs
- **Documentation**: Auto-generated documentation keeps projects maintainable

**The Human + AI Advantage:**
My 10+ years of experience combined with AI assistance means I can deliver production-ready code 2-3x faster, maintain consistent code quality across large codebases, and focus on creative problem-solving while AI handles routine tasks.

*Note: I apply AI-driven development to my web and geospatial work. My game development expertise (100+ published games) was built before these tools existed - that's 10 years of pure hands-on experience.*

## Currently Exploring

I'm always expanding my expertise. Currently diving deep into:

- **Claude Code** - CLI-based AI development workflows for terminal-first productivity
- **Cursor IDE** - AI-first code editor with deep codebase understanding
- **MCP (Model Context Protocol)** - Building integrations for AI-powered development tools
- **AI Agentic Systems** - Exploring autonomous agent architectures and multi-agent workflows
- **LLM Integration** - Connecting large language models with real-world applications
- **Flutter Development** - Building cross-platform mobile apps (personal project in progress)
